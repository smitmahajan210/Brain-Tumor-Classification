## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model:** VGG16 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`
2. Place the dataset in a folder named \`brain_tumor_dataset\`
3. Run the training script: \`python train_model.py\`" > README.md
